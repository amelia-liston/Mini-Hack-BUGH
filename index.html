        <h1>BUGH - student to student grubhub delivery at Boston University</h1>
        <p>
            Have you noticed that, too much food goes to waste when students cannot pick-up their Grub-hub orders. 
            Or how students with food insecurity often cannot get food on campus because they canâ€™t afford it
            Also, students with busy schedules often have to choose between working and academic responsibilities because 
            they can't fit a typical job schedule into their schedule.
            &nbsp;
            Well, there is a way to fix this!
            &nbsp;
            BUGH is an app that creates job security for students on campus in a convenient way that doesn't impact their daily responsibilities.
