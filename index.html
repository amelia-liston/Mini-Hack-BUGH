        <h1>BUGH - student to student grubhub delivery at Boston University</h1>
        <p>
            Have you noticed that, too much food goes to waste when students cannot pick-up their Grub-hub orders. 
            Or how students with food insecurity often cannot get food on campus because they canâ€™t afford it
            Also, students with busy schedules often have to choose between working and academic responsibilities because 
            they can't fit a typical job schedule into their schedule.
            &nbsp;
            Well, there is a way to fix this!
            &nbsp;
            BUGH is an app that creates job security for students on campus in a convenient way that doesn't impact their daily responsibilities. 
            It creates food sustainability and accessibility through pick up and drop off of left over food or never picked up food for a discounted price.
            &nbsp;
            BUGH also creates environmental sustainability through the increased use of student delivery on campus by allowing for less deliveries by vehicles 
            and more by foot, scooter, and bicycles, allowing us to contribute to the less use of carbon and gas emissions, helping the environment.
